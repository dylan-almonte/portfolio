## Welcome

This is the first post on the terminal blog. If you're reading this, the markdown rendering pipeline is working.

### How it works

Blog posts are written as `.md` files inside the `content/blog/` directory. Each file uses YAML frontmatter for metadata:

```yaml
---
title: "Post Title"
date: "2025-01-15"
description: "A short summary."
tags: ["tag1", "tag2"]
---
```

The content below the frontmatter is standard Markdown, rendered at build time.

### What's next

- More posts about things I'm building
- Project case studies
- Notes from the dev trenches

Stay tuned.
